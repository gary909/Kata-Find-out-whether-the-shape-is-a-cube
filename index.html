    <title>Find out whether the shape is a cube</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:<br>
<br>
        volume = Length * Width * Height<br>
<br>
        But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, <br>
        and the length of a single side!<br>
<br>
        It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).<br>
<br>
        Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.<br>
<br>
        Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).<br>
<br>
        Note: the sides must be integers<br>
